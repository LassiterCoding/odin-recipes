# odin-recipes

The current project will be a recipes webpage highlighting different receipes.

This will showcase a working knowledge of basic HTML concepts like headings, paragraphs, lists (unodered and ordered), links (absolute and relative), and images.

This will also demonstrate git version control experience by committing and pushing to Github throughout the project.
